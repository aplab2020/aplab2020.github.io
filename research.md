**Task Planning for Long-Term Autonomy**

<p align="justify">
Our lab research covers the multi-disciplinary subjects of autonomous systems, robotics and AI, with a particular focus on mission planning solutions for long-term autonomy for multi-robot systems. We work to develop mission planning solutions  to achieve persistence, robustness and improved mission execution, considering timelines and the quality of the intelligence gathered. We develop algorithms that can devise, execute and monitor plans, capable of adapting to external conditions, goals priority and robots availability.
